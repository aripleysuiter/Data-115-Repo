# Data-115-Repo
This is a repository for my DATA115 personal dataset project. At this time (week 5)I am not sure what I want to do my research on through I am leaning in the direction of diving into NFL statistics to draw either positional or experience based conlusions

At this time (week 7) I have decided to see how different positions, as well as conferences, and specific teams achievement in college translate to NFL statistics with a few years worth of data. This is subject to change to a more analyzable and concrete research direction if too many issues with consistency arise

Here will be the .csv for the NFL draft order. This information was provided by the excellent [ProFootballRefernece](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/) 

git 2019NFLDraft.csv

Here will be the .csv for the college stats of these NFL rookies. Will somehow want to integrate a filter of positions and of grade - this would have a lot of varience in types of stats so it is important to sort by these 

Here will be the .csv for NFL rookie statistics from 2019-20

Will want to show a side by side of best season in college to best season in NFL 

Will perhaps dive into analyzing by draft round and later looking by conference or school
